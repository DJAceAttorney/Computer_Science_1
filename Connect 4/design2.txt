# Description: Program allows a user to play connect 4 with another player or against a computer.
# The user chooses how big they want the board to be and can keep playing until they want to quit.  

#For getting a random number
from random import randint


#Constants for height and width
MIN_WIDTH = 5
MIN_HEIGHT = 5


#Constants for pieces
PIECE_ONE = "X"
PIECE_TWO = "O"


# getUserChoice() asks the user to select a column to place their piece
#                 and checks if their choice is in the allowed range and
#                 and if they can place their piece in the selected column
# Input:          ; the int width and the 2d list board; the int choice 
# Output:         the user made


# makeBoard()  makes the board based on the width and height the user 
# Input:       chose; the int width and int height; the 2d list board
# Output:      made by the function


# getWidth()   gets the width the user wants and validates if it can
# Input:       be used; no input; the int width
# Output:


# getHeight()  gets the height the user wants and validates if it can
# Input:       be used; no input; the int height
# Output:


# placePiece() places the player's piece in the column the player chose
# Input:       on the board; 2d list board, string player's piece,
# Output:      player's int choice, and int height of the board; the
               updated 2d list board


# printBoard() prints the game board; the 2d list board; no return
# Input:
# Output: 


# getComputerChoice() computer randomly chooses a column to place their
# Input:              piece in; the int width and 2d list board; the
# Output:             computer's int column choice


# checkWin() Checks if the player or computer won the game; the 2d list
# Input:     board and the player or computer's string piece, int width  
# Output:    and int height of the board; a boolean True if win or False
  	     if not win

# checkTie() Checks if the game is a tie if the board is filled; the
# Input:     2d list board and the int width; a boolean True if tie 
# Output:    or False if not tie
